1) Representing raw MS ( MASS SPECTROMETER ) data visually
2) Viewing proteomics data in a genome browser 
3) Visualizing distribution of peptide hits counts to find threshold
4) converting MS formats to move data between tools
5) Matching spectra to peptides for verification with protViz
6) Applying quality control filters to spectra
7) identifying genomics loci that match peptides
