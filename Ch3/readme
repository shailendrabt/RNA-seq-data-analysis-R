Searching genes and proteins for domains and motifs
The following steps will be covered in this chapter--
finding DNA motifs with universalmotifs
finding protein doamains using PFAM and bio3d
finding interpro domains
Performing multiple alignments of the gene or proteins
Aligning genomic length sequence with DECIPHER 
Machine learning for novel feature detection in protein
3D structure protein alignment with bio3d
