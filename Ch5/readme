########### METAGENOMICS #################
1) Loading in hierarchical taxanomic data using phyloseq
2) Rarefying counts to correct for sample difference using metacoder
3) Reading amplicon data from raw reads with data2
4) Visualizing taxonomic abundances with heat trees in metacoder
5) Computing sample diversity with vegan
6) spliting sequence files into operationals taxonomic units
