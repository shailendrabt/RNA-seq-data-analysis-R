(Ch2 = chapter 2)

Finding Gnenetic variants with HTS(high throughput sequencing) Data
In this chapter , we will cover the following steps

Finding SNPs and indels in sequence data using variant tools
Predicting open reading frames in long reference sequences
Plotting features on genetics mapa with karyoploteR
Finding alternative transcript isoform
Selecting and classifying varriants with VrriantAnnotation
Extracting information in genomic regions of interest
Finding phenotype and genotype associations with GWAS 
Estimating the copy number at a locus at a locus of interest....
