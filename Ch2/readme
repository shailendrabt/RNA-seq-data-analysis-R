(Ch2 = chapter 2)

Finding Gnenetic variants with HTS(high throughput sequencing) Data
In this chapter , we will cover the following steps

Finding SNPs and indels in sequence data using variant tools
Predicting open reading frames in long reference sequences
Plotting features on genetics mapa with karyoploteR
Finding alternative transcript isoform
Selecting and classifying varriants with VrriantAnnotation
Extracting information in genomic regions of interest
Finding phenotype and genotype associations with GWAS 
Estimating the copy number at a locus at a locus of interest....

GenomeInfoDb- Utilities for manipulating chromosome names, including modifying them to follow a particular naming style
rtracklayerR - interface to genome annotation files and the UCSC genome browser
Biostrings- Efficient manipulation of biological strings
GenomicRanges- Representation and manipulation of genomic intervals
gmapR - An R interface to the GMAP/GSNAP/GSTRUCT suite
karyoploteR- is an R package to create karyoplots, that is, representations of whole genomes with arbitrary data plotted on them. It is inspired by the R base graphics system and does not depend on other graphics packages. 
The aim of karyoploteR is to offer the user an easy way to plot data along the genome to get broad genome-wide view to facilitate the identification of genome wide relations and distributions.
