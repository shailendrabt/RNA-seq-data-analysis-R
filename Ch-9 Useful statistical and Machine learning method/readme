the following steps will be covered in this chapter------------
1) Correcting p-value to account for multiple hypothesis
2) Generating a simulated dataset to represent a background
3) Learning groupings within data and claasifying with kNN
4) Predinting  classes withn randomForest
5) Predicting classes with SVM
6) Learning groups in data without prior information
7) Identifying the most important variables in data with trandom forest
8) Identifying the most important variables in data with PCA
